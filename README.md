# Forecasting the Trajectory of Pneumonia and Influenza Death Rates Post-COVID-19: A Time Series Analysis Using the SARIMA Model 

This is a repo of a project related to time series analysis from my statistics undergraduate course, STA457: Time Series Analysis, at the University of Toronto. The full description of the project can be found in `Final_Project_Winter2022.pdf`.

## Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the death rates of pneumonia and influenza, using historical data from the Hong Kong flu pandemic as a benchmark. The study employs a SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future trends in the death rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing parallels with the aftermath of the Hong Kong flu. The analysis includes spectral analysis to identify dominant frequencies within the data, providing insights into seasonal trends. The findings suggest a gradual decline in the death rates of pneumonia and influenza over time, indicating a potential return to pre-pandemic normalcy. The project highlights the utility of time series analysis in understanding and predicting the long-term impacts of global health crises on mortality rates related to respiratory illnesses.
